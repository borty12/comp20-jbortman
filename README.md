Finalizing My Learning Portfolio
Jeff Bortman

What is the purpose of this Git repository?

This repository contains all of the projects that I created on my own during the fall 2016 semester in Comp20 - Web Programming at Tufts University. The contents of this repository will serve as concrete examples of my coding ability that I can use in the future for examples for future projects and as a personal programming portfolio. 

What was my favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was the MBTA assignment because it was truly an assignment with real world application that I will actually choose to use in the future whenever I am taking the red line. This was also the first lab where I learned how to be patient in computer science since it was a real struggle making all of the pieces come together, but that only made the end product more rewarding.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course?

I have grown immensely from day one in this course. I began as a beginner computer scientist and finished with a strong knowledge in what it means to create, secure, and maintain web programs. I also learned important qualities that have nothing to do with the actual coding side of the course such as teamwork, communication, and watching out for every little detail. 

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course?

The most important things that I learned were perseverance and how to ask for help. On many occasions  my code simply was not doing as I wanted it to do but I had to stick with it to push through to the final product. Whether it be going to ask for a push from the TAs in Halligan or going to Ming to get simple things like the VM set up, using all of my resources along the journey was also important. For example, on the 2048 assignment I could not figure out why my heroku app was not updating upon submission, but with a small push from the Halligan TAs I was able to find the issue and correct it. I also had to persevere on the MBTA project, perusing the different web resources for hours to figure out how to use the Haversine function correctly. 

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I would love to check out securities more. The final lab was so fun and really helped outline for me the many issues that could be underlying all the websites that I visit each day. Where a building has a wall for protection, you rarely thing of websites having something similar, yet stronger and less visible and that thought is so cool to me.

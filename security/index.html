		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>"2048" is a gaming web application where the player is given a square 4x4 grid populated by two random tiles reading either "2" or "4". The player controls the game board by swiping in one of four directions which then moves all tiles to the selected direction. The game populates the board with a new random tile (either a 2 or a 4) with each swipe. The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number, resulting in a new tile with double the value. A player may win the game by combining enough tiles to create the infamous "2048" tile. A player loses the game when all 16 slots are filled with tiles with no adjacent same-number tials. Either a win or a loss will prompt the player to submit a username.</p> 
		<p>The score and username, along with a timestamp and data about the final board appearance then gets stored to a database in MongoDB. When called upon, the database then returns two pages: the first sorts the data by high score and returns the username, score, and timestamp with the highest score at the top; the second parses the query string and returns data for a specific player in JSON format including the score, timestamp, and information on the final board appearance.</p>
		<p>I have been hired to identify, describe, and suggest resolutions for any security issues that the game and corresponding database may have. I have been hired to do so since neither the game nor the database were designed by the creator, Sartrapat Poolvaraluck, with security in mind, yet it still stores valuable user information that must be protected.</p>

	<div id = "methodology">
		<h3>Methodology</h3>
		<p>I began by connecting to Sartrapat's 2048 data storage database hosted on heroku <a href="https://secret-scrubland-77318.herokuapp.com/">located here</a> to test the code using "black box attacks." A "black box attack" is one where the hacker does not have access to the source code. Next, I reviewed Sartrapat's source code to look for any further vulnerabilities.</p>
		<p>Tools used:
		<ul>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		</ul>
		</p>

	<div id = "abstract">
		<h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
		<p>One of the largest overarching security issues that I found in Sartrapat's version of 2048 is the application's inability to check for malicious data entry. If the application had the ability to check and validate user input many of the issues that I found would be easily resolved.</p>

		<h3>Issues Found</h3>

		<p>
		<h4>Issue 1 - Malicious javascript can be inserted into the server when 
		entered in place of a username</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Location: https://secret-scrubland-77318.herokuapp.com/</li>
		<li>Severity of the issue: High - a hacker could potentially insert malicious data into the database by inserting a line of javascript into the username entry box. One should never trust user input.</li>
		<li> Description - I found this issue when I first opened the heroku app while "black boxing" and noticed that the previously stored usernames returned by the server were stored as plain text. <img src="plain-text-ex.PNG" alt = "Usernames were stored as plain text"> Because of this I was able to insert my own javascript into the username box: <img src = "js-box-insertion.PNG" alt = "The js code I manually inserted into the username box"></li>
		<li>Proof of vulnerability - When I checked https://secret-scrubland-77318.herokuapp.com/to see if my javascript could be returned by the server, this is what I received: <img src = "js-server-insertion.PNG" alt = "Proof of the javascript insertion in Heroku"></li>
		<li>Resolution - </li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
		<h4>Issue 2 - Blank usernames can be returned by the server</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Location: https://secret-scrubland-77318.herokuapp.com/</li>
		<li>Severity of the issue: High - there should be core code that will check the validity of anything that gets sent to the server, never trust user input</li>
		<li> Description - I found this issue when I first opened the heroku app while "black boxing" and noticed that the previously stored usernames returned by the server contained empty spaces where usernames should have been entered. <img src "blank-usernames.PNG" alt = "Blank usernames were accepted by the server as acceptable username inputs"></li>
		<li>Proof of Vulnerability - Sartrapat attempted to deal with this issue by inserting "anonymous" any time the username box was left without an entry. <img src "core-code-anonymous.PNG" alt = "Core code attempts to check for null and replace with anonymous"> However Sartrapat checked for "null" which is an unfavorable practice in javascript, and thus some blank spaces were still inserted into the returned data.</li>
		<li>Resolution - </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
